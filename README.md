This meetup should be interesting if you've heard of frameworks like Backbone, Ember, Angular and React and want to learn more about how they work. We will give a brief overview of the history of single page web applications before diving into a minimal implementation of a framework that provides a model, view and router.

## Agenda

* Brief history of the SPA
* Build a minimal SPA framework from the ground up
* Discuss pros and cons of the SPA approach
* Q/A
